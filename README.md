PROJECT 2 README

Title: Shakespearian Password Generator

Description:
I found a complete list of every word ever used in the complete works of Shakespeare. I then removed any word less than 3 characters and created a csv. For the site I used the p2 demo site as a template.
I did not do a screencast for this project. I learned from my p1 grade comments that screencasts are the preferred format for demo videos but I had already submitted my demo video for p2.
